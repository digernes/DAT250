# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4
[Link to assignment description](https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250public/blob/master/expassignments/expass4.md)

## Experiment 1: Spark/Java Framework project and Postman

Had no problems in E1. 

## Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items

Experiment 2 also went ok. I did not create a new "_Request"-class for each action, as it worked when only defining in the App class.
